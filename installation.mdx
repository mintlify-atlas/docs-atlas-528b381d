### Beaver Builder Button Not Appearing

Beaver Builder automatically attempts to increase PHP memory limits when the editor is active. For optimal performance:
- Ensure your server has at least 256MB of PHP memory
- Keep WordPress, your theme, and all plugins up to date
- Consider a quality hosting provider optimized for WordPress
</Info>

### Theme Compatibility

Beaver Builder is designed to work with almost any WordPress theme. However, for best results:

- Use a theme that follows WordPress coding standards
- Avoid themes with heavy built-in page builders
- Consider the official Beaver Builder Theme for maximum compatibility

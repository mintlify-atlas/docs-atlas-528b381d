Beaver Builder seamlessly integrates with WordPress core functionality, providing native support for themes, custom post types, widgets, and shortcodes.

## Theme Compatibility

Beaver Builder works with virtually any WordPress theme through its comprehensive compatibility layer.

### Automatic Theme Support

The builder automatically detects and adapts to your active theme:

- **Content Width**: Respects theme content width settings
- **Color Schemes**: Inherits theme color palettes
- **Typography**: Uses theme font settings by default
- **Template Hierarchy**: Follows WordPress template structure

### Theme-Specific Fixes

The compatibility class (`FLBuilderCompatibility`) includes automatic fixes for popular themes:

```php class-fl-builder-compatibility.php
// Twenty Twenty theme video support
public static function fix_twenty_twenty_video( $classes ) {
    if ( 'twentytwenty' == get_option( 'template' ) ) {
        $classes[] = 'intrinsic-ignore';
    }
    return $classes;
}
```

<Note>
  Beaver Builder includes compatibility fixes for dozens of popular WordPress themes, ensuring smooth operation regardless of your theme choice.
</Note>

## Post Types Support

Beaver Builder can be enabled on any public post type in WordPress.

### Built-in Post Types

- **Posts**: Full builder support on blog posts
- **Pages**: Complete page building capabilities
- **Custom Post Types**: Enable builder on any custom post type

### Enabling on Custom Post Types

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings → Page Builder → Post Types**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Post Types">
    Check the boxes for post types where you want to enable the builder
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save Post Types** to apply your settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Post Type Restrictions

Some post types are intentionally restricted for compatibility:

- Builder templates (`fl-builder-template`)
- Theme layouts (`fl-theme-layout`)
- BuddyPress pages (compatibility reasons)

<Warning>
  The builder automatically disables itself on BuddyPress pages to prevent conflicts with the BuddyPress content filter.
</Warning>

## Widget Support

Beaver Builder includes a dedicated **WordPress Widgets** module that allows you to add any registered WordPress widget to your layouts.

### Using WordPress Widgets

1. Add a **WordPress Widgets** module to your layout
2. Select the widget you want to use from the dropdown
3. Configure the widget settings
4. The widget will render with full functionality

### Widget Compatibility

The builder includes specific compatibility fixes for popular widget plugins:

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Google Reviews" icon="star">

  </Card>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Shortcode Support

Beaver Builder fully supports WordPress shortcodes with several built-in features.

### HTML Module Shortcodes

Add any shortcode to the **HTML** module:

```html
[your-shortcode attribute="value"]
```

Shortcodes are automatically processed and rendered in the builder preview and on the frontend.

### Builder Shortcode

Insert builder layouts anywhere using the shortcode:

```html
[fl_builder_insert_layout slug="your-layout-slug"]
```

Or by ID:

```html
[fl_builder_insert_layout id="123"]
```

<Warning>
  To prevent infinite loops, the builder prevents inserting a layout within itself when the shortcode is found in search results.
</Warning>

### Shortcode Compatibility Fixes

The compatibility layer includes fixes for problematic shortcodes:

- **ActiveMember360**: Removes duplicate rendering
- **iMember360**: Prevents double execution
- **Ninja Forms**: Ensures JS templates render correctly
- **Tasty Recipes**: Prevents editor conflicts

### Conflicting Shortcodes

Some SEO plugins try to process shortcodes too early. The builder automatically handles this:

```php class-fl-builder-compatibility.php
// AIOSEO conflicting shortcodes
public static function aioseo_conflicting_shortcodes( $shortcodes ) {
    $shortcodes['Beaver Builder'] = '[fl_builder_insert_layout';
    return $shortcodes;
}
```

## Admin Bar Integration

When the builder is active, additional options appear in the WordPress admin bar:

- **Edit with Beaver Builder**: Quick access to builder mode
- **Duplicate**: Clone pages/posts (with compatible plugins)
- **Builder Admin**: Access builder settings

<Tip>
  In WordPress 6.4+, Beaver Builder includes automatic admin bar styling fixes to ensure proper display in the builder interface.
</Tip>

## Media Library Integration

Beaver Builder integrates deeply with the WordPress media library:

### Photo Cropping

The builder includes built-in photo cropping with support for:

- **TinyPNG**: Automatic compression of cropped images
- **Jetpack Photon**: Compatibility fixes for circle-cropped images
- **Custom Crop Sizes**: Define custom aspect ratios

### CORS Fix for SSL

If you have `FORCE_SSL_ADMIN` enabled but your frontend isn't SSL, the builder includes an automatic fix for upload errors:

```php class-fl-builder-compatibility.php
public static function admin_ssl_upload_fix() {
    if ( defined( 'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN' ) && ! is_ssl() 
         && is_admin() && FLBuilderAJAX::doing_ajax() ) {
        if ( apply_filters( 'fl_admin_ssl_upload_fix', true ) ) {
            force_ssl_admin( false );
        }
    }
}
```

## REST API Support

Beaver Builder layouts are accessible via the WordPress REST API:

- Layout content renders automatically in REST responses
- Builder data is included in post meta
- Custom excerpt generation for builder content
- Full compatibility with headless WordPress setups

<Check>
  Builder content automatically appears in REST API responses without any additional configuration required.

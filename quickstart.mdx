# Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through creating your first page with Beaver Builder. You'll learn the basics of the interface, how to add content modules, and how to publish your page.

<Info>
Before starting, make sure you've [installed Beaver Builder](/installation) on your WordPress site.
</Info>

## Creating Your First Page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Page">
    From your WordPress admin dashboard, go to **Pages > Add New**. Give your page a title (e.g., "My First Beaver Builder Page").
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch Beaver Builder">
    Click the **Beaver Builder** button in the WordPress admin bar at the top of the screen, or click the Beaver Builder button on the page edit screen. The page will reload with the Beaver Builder interface.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Understand the Interface">
    You'll see several key elements:
    - **Top Bar:** Contains tools, templates, and the Done button
    - **Right Panel:** Shows available modules and content blocks
    - **Canvas:** The main editing area where you'll build your page
    - **Overlays:** Hover over elements to see editing options (gear icon, duplicate, delete)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Rows and Columns

Beaver Builder uses a row and column layout system. Before adding content, you need to add rows and columns:

<Note>
**Layout Structure:**
- **Rows** are full-width containers that hold columns
- **Columns** sit inside rows and hold your content modules
- **Modules** are the actual content elements (text, images, buttons, etc.)
</Note>

### Adding Your First Row

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Row">
    Click the **+** (plus) icon in the top right corner, or click anywhere on the empty canvas. Select **Add Row** from the options.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose a Column Layout">
    A panel will appear showing different column layouts (1 column, 2 columns, 3 columns, etc.). Click a layout to insert it. For this tutorial, select a **2 column** layout.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View Your Row">
    The row will appear on your page with two equal-width columns, indicated by dashed blue outlines.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Content Modules

Now let's add some content to your page using Beaver Builder's modules.

### Adding a Heading Module

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Modules Panel">
    Click the **+** icon in the top right, or click the **Modules** tab in the right panel.

  <Step title="Drag the Module">
    Click and drag the **Heading** module into your left column. Drop it when you see a blue highlight.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the Heading">
    The module settings panel will open automatically. Enter your heading text (e.g., "Welcome to My Website"). Choose a heading tag (H1 is good for main titles). Click **Save** in the top right of the settings panel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding a Photo Module
